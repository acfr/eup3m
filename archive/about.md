This directory has been left empty deliberately. If users wish to run 
`notebook/statistical_analysis.ipynb`, we recommend populating this directory `<eup3m>/archive`
first with contents that may be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14532697

- Unpack the ZIP archive into `<eup3m>/archive`.
- Under `<eup3m>/archive`, there should be two directories: `future-bench-prediction` and `in-situ-regression`.
  - These contain precomputed grade estimation results for the case of extrapolation and interpolation.
- Further information about the files can be found in `README.md` from the download site.
